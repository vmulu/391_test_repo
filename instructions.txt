In this repo I added the question.txt and random.txt. 

Within these files I followed the correct commit stream that was need to 
complete this assignment. 

During this assignment I forked the intern-bootcamp-git repo and added my 
feature branch. 

This branch was used to make a PR request into the upstream repo that has now
been closed. 

The link to my forked repo is below.
